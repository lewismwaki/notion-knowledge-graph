# Implementation Notes

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed NOTION_ROOT_PAGE_ID Usage**
   - Updated `fetchPages.ts` to properly start from the root page ID
   - Added recursive page fetching from the root page
   - Maintained backward compatibility with search API for standalone pages

2. **Improved Database Relations Handling**
   - Added `processDatabase` function in `fetchBlocks.ts` to handle database relations
   - Enhanced `processBlocksForPage` to properly process child databases

3. **Implemented Node Clustering**
   - Created clustering logic in `clustering.ts`
   - Added two clustering methods:
     - By tags: Groups nodes based on their tags
     - By connections: Uses simple community detection to group connected nodes
   - Updated `buildGraph.ts` to include clustering data in the output

4. **Added Clustering UI**
   - Updated frontend to support clustering toggle
   - Added cluster type selection (tags vs. connections)
   - Implemented visual differentiation of clusters by color

## Known Issues and Remaining Tasks

1. **TypeScript/JSX Configuration**
   - The frontend TypeScript setup needs resolution for JSX compilation
   - Consider running `npm run build` to check for specific errors

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test clustering functionality with real Notion data
   - Verify database relations are properly extracted
   - Check that the incremental sync mechanism works as expected

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - With 1,000+ nodes, graph rendering might need optimization
   - Consider adding pagination or lazy loading for large graphs

## Technical Documentation

### Backend Architecture

1. **Notion API Integration**
   - `notionClient.ts` - Base client for Notion API
   - `fetchPages.ts` - Recursive page fetching with sync state tracking
   - `fetchBlocks.ts` - Block traversal for mentions and database relations
   - `extractGraphData.ts` - Transform Notion data to graph format

2. **Graph Processing**
   - `buildGraph.ts` - Main orchestration for graph building
   - `clustering.ts` - Node clustering algorithms

3. **Utilities**
   - `rateLimiter.ts` - Handles Notion API rate limiting
   - `idNormalizer.ts` - Consistent handling of Notion UUIDs

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Core Components**
   - `App.tsx` - Main application with state management
   - `Graph.tsx` - Graph visualization with Sigma.js
   - `SearchFilter.tsx` - Search and tag filtering

2. **Graph Visualization**
   - Uses Sigma.js for rendering
   - Handles node clustering, highlighting and interactions

## Next Steps

1. Fix the TypeScript configuration to resolve JSX errors
2. Run the application and test with actual Notion data
3. Address any performance issues with large graphs
4. Consider adding more advanced filtering options
